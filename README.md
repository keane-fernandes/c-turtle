# Features


# Overview
Many attempts have been made to create programming languages which are intuitive and easy to learn.
One of the best of these was LOGO which allowed children as young as 3 to learn a computer language.
A subset of this language involved a “turtle” which could be driven around the screen using simple instructions. The turtle, when viewed from above, was represented by a triangle.

# Design

# Usage
Ensure you have [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) installed on your machine. Once you have done so, run the following command on your terminal to compile and run an example of the basic version:

```bash
make turtle
```
